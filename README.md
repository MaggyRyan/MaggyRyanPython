This repo contains the code and final report for Maggy Ryan's STA 141B final project. 

This project aimed to extract the lower-division prerequisite courses for each UC Davis undergradaute major and create a list of suggeted courses for each college at UC Davis for students who were unsure what exactly they wanted to study.

In order to understand what is happening and how graphics were made, it is recommended that you read the files in the following order:

1) Text Extracting Code Maggy Ryan:
    This file contains the code used to extract the data used for the project. It has three main sections: a function for extracting UC Davis classes, a function for extracting all of the undergraduate majors, and a section for sorting the majors from the College of Letters and Science into subcategories.

2) Data Visualziation:
    This file contains the code used to create the graphics that were used in the "written conclusions" file.  It also includes some data cleaning.

3) Written Report and Conclusions:
    This file contains the written questions, conclusions, and visuals generated in the second file. Please note that the only code in this file is to call graphics created in the "Data Visualziation" folder. This was done to prevent clutter from the two code-based files to increase the readability of the final report.
        
The first two notebooks contain cells above the sections of code that explain what each section is meant to accomplish. There are additional docstrings and comments in the actual code to help you understand my thought process as well as what I was attempting to accomplish.
